# IAntz

IAntz is a top-down resoure management game, where the player is owner of an anthill and the objective is to make that place the greatest ant colony. Defend it from enemy ants that want the collapse of the anthill, maintain the Queen to perpetuate the future of the colony and construct new rooms and expand the base to make a stronger home for the ants.

### 0.1

In this early version the player only have the possibility to change between two major states in the game, clicking the button that says Day/Night. This will dramatically change the behaviour of the ants making them go to the dorms inside the colony. By clicking it again it will restore the normal day routines of each type of ant.
